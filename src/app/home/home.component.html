          <p>The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has been designated as a Patent and Trademark Resource Center (PTRC) by the
            United States Patent and Trademark Office.
    
            The UNLV Libraries Patent & Trademark Resource Center, Powered by Switch is the result of a partnership between
            UNLV University Libraries, the UNLV Wiener-Rogers Law Library, and Switch. A grand opening of the new PTRC was
            held on Nov. 15.
    
            “The UNLV Libraries are the perfect home for the Patent and Trademark Resource Center, as our librarians work to
            connect individuals with information and resources they need for success and innovation,” said Maggie Farrell,
            dean of libraries at UNLV. “This designation also continues to center UNLV at the heart of economic development
            in Las Vegas and Southern Nevada and furthers our Top Tier mission in socio-economic development and community
            partnerships.”
    
            Switch has partnered with the UNLV Libraries to partially fund the PTRC, pledging a generous gift for the
            establishment of the PTRC office in Lied Library, as well as supporting training and programming for services
            offered by the USPTO.
    
            “We are honored to be a part of this initiative,” said Betsy Fretwell, EVP of Strategy at Switch. “Over several
            years, Switch has maintained a long and robust history of supporting key public, private and research-related
            projects with UNLV. The UNLV Libraries U.S. Patent & Trademark Resource Center designation has a special meaning
            for our organization."
    
            Fretwell said that Switch Founder and CEO Rob Roy has over 400 pending and registered trademarks, in addition to
            the more than 700 issued and pending patent claims covering data center designs that have manifested into the
            company’s world-renowned data centers and technology solutions.</p>
